## Homework feedback

2.5 hours

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

I thought it was straight forward and challenging as well. I don't think any part of it could be done better. Perhaps the directions could explain why you need to use the exact "__avg" format for parsing a dictionary as I don't know why it is like that. 

## Feedback

Good work.  The `age_range` method was plopped into the wrong class, but once moved over to `Product` (instead of `Review` it was fine).
